Under a spreading chestnut-tree
The village smithy stands
The smith, a mighty man is he
With large and sinewy hands
And the muscles of his brawny arms
Are strong as iron bands

His hair is crisp and black and long
His face is like the tan
His brow is wet with honest sweat
He earns whateer he can
And looks the whole world in the face
For he owes not any man
